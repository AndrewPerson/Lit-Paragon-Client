# Paragon

Paragon is a fast and lightweight timetable app for Sydney Boys.

Paragon has:

1. Offline functionality.
2. Ridiculously fast load times.
3. A student ID barcode generator. (Based off Neel Karma's [School ID Forge](https://github.com/neelkarma/schoolidforge).)
4. Extensions. (Coming early 2022!)
5. And anything else you would expect, like a timetable.ðŸ˜‰

Paragon is built with love. (And [Lit](https://lit.dev).)

The server for Paragon can be found [here](https://github.com/AndrewPerson/IBM-Paragon-Server).
